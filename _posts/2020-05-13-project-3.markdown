description: For my first independent work project in computer science, I developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to play the Game Boy game "Backyard Baseball" (2006). By implementing a Deep Q-Network with a Convolutional Neural Network architecture, I successfully trained an agent to hit home runs and throw strikes.
